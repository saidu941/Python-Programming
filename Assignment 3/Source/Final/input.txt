More than a dozen wildfires raged across Northern California for the third straight day Tuesday, with the biggest ones killing at least 15 people, scorching the state's famous wine country, and forcing more than 20,000 people to evacuate, authorities said.

The largest fires were burning in Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties, with flames ripping through the lush, picturesque landscape.
It is too early to tell whether any of the wildfires were started by humans, said Ken Pimlott, director of Cal Fire. "All these fires are under investigation," he told reporters, adding that his department was focusing on rescues and firefighting. But he said the chance the fires were caused by lightning was "fairly minimal."

Here's what we know so far, according to California authorities.
 At least 15 people have died since Sunday night, when most of the fires began. Nine deaths were in Sonoma County, officials said.
 Two of those who died were in Napa County, county spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said. They were 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his wife, Sara, 98. They died when a fire engulfed their home near the Silverado Country Club north of Napa, Jourdan said.
